# Hue You Know

### About: 
    Hue You know is a concentration match game. Concentration games test your memory as they're a visual brain teaser. For further reading on memory games and its effect on brain health, read this [blogpost](https://telehealth.keckmedicine.org/blog/can-brain-games-improve-your-memory/#:~:text=While%20some%20brain%20games%20claim,maintain%20or%20improve%20brain%20health.) from Keck Medicine. 
    
    Typically, in concentration games, an even amount of cards are placed face down in a series of rows and columns. The user then flips two cards at a time in an attempt to match the first flipped card with its exact pair. If the user is successful, the cards remain facing up and points may be awarded. However, if the match is incorrect, the cards will be returned to its face down position and the user must try again. This is continued until all cards are matched and facing up. 

    In Hue You Know, the user will be matching colors. As the levels progress, the difficulty intensifies as the colors become closer in hues. For example, Level 3 will be matching shades of blue, Level 4 will be matching shades of red, etc. Level 7 being the most difficult as it has it features grayscale. In addition, unlike most concentration games, Hue You Know will only allow the users 9 attempts before they must start over. Happy Matching!
