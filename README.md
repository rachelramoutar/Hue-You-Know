# Hue You Know

### About
Hue You know is a concentration match game. Concentration games test your memory as they're a
visual brain teaser. For further reading on memory games and its effect on brain health, 
please see the blogpost from Keck Medicine listed in the Sources Section. 
    
Typically, in concentration games, an even amount of cards are placed face down in a series 
of rows and columns. The user then flips two cards at a time in an attempt to match the first
flipped card with its exact pair. If the user is successful, the cards remain facing up and
points may be awarded. However, if the match is incorrect, the cards will be returned to its
face down position and the user must try again. This is continued until all cards are matched 
and facing up. 

In Hue You Know, the user will be matching colors. As the levels progress, the difficulty
intensifies as the colors become closer in hues. For example, Level 3 will be matching shades
of blue, Level 4 will be matching shades of red, etc. Level 7 being the most difficult as it 
has it features grayscale. In addition, unlike most concentration games, Hue You Know will only
allow the users 9 attempts before they must start over. Happy Matching!
